## Rules of the universe 

### The Law of Divine Oneness
Everything that happens is a part of a unifying 'plan'. Every thought you have, every word you speak, every 'fail' and 'win', EVERYTHING that happens is supposed to happen.
All is energy
Microcoasm of a macrocasm 

### Law of Vibration 
Everything in the universe is in constant motion and carrying energy. From planet formations all the way down to physical objects, thoughts, light, ect.. All on their own frequency.

### Law of Action
Brings some practitionership into the mix. You must engage in action / do (things) to be able to bring a manifestation or thought into reality. 
The Law of Action says that you must actively pursue your dreams/thoughts to bring them into reality. 
For the The Law of Attraction to work, you must first take action. 


### Law of Correspondence 
Like the laws of physics - light, vibration, and motion all have corresponding principles  

"as above, so below"

what happens on the inside, your outside will be also

 as within, so without 

### Law of Cause and Effect 
Every action, to the smallest degree (eg; thought), cases a reaction or consequence. This would mean that nothing happens by chance or 'at random' in the universe. 

Mostly thought about in the physical world, this law also applies to the Etheric world.

Interestingly enough, the physical world has a case and effect of the Ethiric world - and vise versa. 

"we reap what we sow"

### Law of Compensation
You receive what you put out.

While similar to the Law of Attraction - The Law of Compensation has more of a focus on compensation (good or bad) can come in many forms.

"we reap what we sow" - be careful of how you treat others, and indeed the planet.

### Law of Attraction
Is how we bring things, people and events in to fruition. This is the law that says 'like attracts like'. For anything to happen in your life you must first vibrate on the same frequency as those things. If you want more positivity, you must first be positive - likewise with negativity.


- Our thoughts, feelings, words, and actions produce energies which, in turn attract like energies
- Negative energies attract negative energies and positive energies attract positive energies.

### The Law of Perpetual Transmutation of Energy 
Everything is conducting itself with energy and is in constant motion, mostly at an atomic / cellular level.

As Humans, we have the ability to change the energies that we put into the world. This is important when we want to trigger positive energy - in junction with the Law of Action, you can take (even the smallest) action and start the process of change. 

Higher vibrations consume and transform lower ones. 
Higher vibrations being more positive and lower, negative. 
So by conducting yourself at a higher vibration, you will start the process of taking over / rising lower vibrations.

### Law of Gestation



### Law of Relativity 
is about how you look at a situation. "Perspective" if you will.

Something can only be good or bad when compared to something else, right? Otherwise it just.. is.
Alone, everything is neutral but when thought in relation to something else can become a good thing or a bad thing. 

You can be rich with $100 because others have less or you can be poor with $100 because others have more, it's what you look at in comparison to it
With this in mind, you can become more grateful.


- We will all receive problems in life (test of intuition / lessons ) for the purpose of strengthening the light within 

### Law of polarity 
Everything has an opposite. 
Low vibrations - high vibrations.

Good to keep in mind when you are feeling down or having a hard time. 
There isn't just a better way of looking at the situation but probably a lesson to be learned.

- Everything is on a continuum and has an opposite 
- we can suppress (negative) thoughts by concentrating on the opposite pole
- The law of mental vibrations(?)

### Law of Rhythm - aka Law of Perpetual Motion
Based on motion, the Law of Rhythm refers to the face that everything works in cycles.
Eg; Nature - seasons and such

Also, found in life cycles. The Law of Rhythm says that you might not be in the best spot now but that might just be preparing you for future endeavour. 

	Interestingly enough, I have always said that i smoke weed in cycles.
	In the past i have smoked a lot, then stopped to do something else, then, eventually came back to smoking heaps. 

### Law of Belief 

### Law of Gender 
Masculinity and femininity - Yin and Yang - Anima and Anumus.

Not so much as male and female but more to do with the types of energy.
Yin and Yang.


- manifests in all things - animal kingdom and plant matter 
- This law decrees everything in nature is both male and female
- Both required for life to exist

Etheric world - emotions and 
physical world - 'where we live



Law of vibration
Everything in the universe is made up of vibrating matter.  [Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light) travels / vibrates on wavelength, with a frequency range of roughly 430â€“750 terahertz.
