# Epigenetics


## Google Explanation 
The study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself.

## Word Breakdown 
"Epi" meaning above in Greek and "genetics" meaning the study of genes.

"Epigenetics" is the study of features that are 'in addition to' or 'on top of' the normal genetic inheritance. 


## INFO PUKE 

Genome Stays the same 

the epigenome doesn't change your DNA but decides how much or if at all a gene is expressed 

all cells hold the same DNA 
all cells have a different epigenes 


## What controls Epigenetics 
Gnomes are controlled by Methyl Groups and Histones.

Methyl groups are made up of carbon and hydrogen.



Methyl groups work as a switch 
Histones work like a nob

Methyl groups stick to the gnome by saying do not express this...

also controlled by histones




## Methyl Groups

Are the DNA "instructions". 
They consist of carbon and hydrogen.
