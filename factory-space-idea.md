# factory-space-idea

A place for me to share and build upon the **factory-space-idea**.
The idea is bigger than just a factory space, its all about the **idea**.

```
	I feel like this idea is a scaled version of me waning to live with as many of the 'the right' people as possible. 
	If life was like a tree, i would say that i would want to grow and intertwine with people
	aka - rent the biggest house and full it with good people 
```

## Rough Explanation
My factory-space-idea is a physical space where good people with good intentions can get together, collaborate, and learn. 

s

## Space intentions
I would say the intention is to get **good** people in the room.

## Space Objectives
 - Learning
 - Teaching to learn
 - Attracting the right minds
  - Anyone that attends the space, is the right person
 - allowing the right people to be around the right people

A space built around the mind and body connection, the limitlessness of the mind, and passions.
A space where teaching and learning is natural and intentional. 

help others gain the power of the mind 
 - mind-body connection
 - consciousness 
 - passion
  - each other's passions
 - how to live outside the 9-5 realm


a place to bring more open minds into the same room and encourage them to open it

it will be a building with:
 - Sectionable / open plan kitchen, lounge, rec area
 - Ready to go podcast room(s)
 - Meeting rooms
  - tabel andd chairs
  - couch 


## Teaching Calendar
An open calendar that contains the lessons and availability of areas. 

Embracing the [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) teaching to learn idea
Every student will have the opportunity to teach
Everyone will have the opportunity to learn.


anyone that wants to teach/run a session will be 

an area where people can learn and teach
no one will be a teacher nor a student but both 

if you know whats going on, you will be encouraged to help others learn
if you don't know, you will be encouraged to learn 

built around the mind-body connection, embracing, and teaching the energetic connection

## Locations?
### Factory
They already have the office spaces, a kitchen, and an open recreational area.


The office spaces could be renovated into a podcast room and a small meeting room. 
 The podcasts space will be plug and play, no set up required. 
 Having no setup required allows there to be less friction when ideating/communicating.  

The kitchen will be fully stocked equipment-wise and built in an open plan manner. 
Allowing anyone to cook anything, and allowing them to use the space to teach. 

### Geographically
I think it should be close to;
 - public transport
 - A highway / main road
 - Parking lot
 - Accommodation
