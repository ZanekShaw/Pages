# factory-space-idea

A place for me to share and build upon the **factory-space-idea**.
The idea is more significant than just a factory space; it's about hosting people and allowing them to do their best.


>	I feel like this idea is a scaled version of me wanting to live with as many of the 'the right' people as possible. 
>	If life were like a tree, I would say that I would want to grow and intertwine with people
>	aka - rent the most significant house and full it with good people 


## Rough Explanation
My factory-space-idea is a physical space (like a factory) where good people with good intentions can get together, collaborate, and learn. 

## Space intentions
The intention of the space is to host those who want to learn, grow, build, inspire, and share.

## Location 1
This is the first location where this idea can get deployed. 
A 2m(ish) square office in Berwick, small but big enough. 2 walls windows, and 2 walls solid.

## IDEA PUKE 
 - Learning
 - Teaching to learn
 - Attracting the right minds
  - Anyone that attends the space is the right person
 - allowing the right people to be around the right people

A space built around the mind and body connection, the limitlessness of the mind, and passions.
Space where teaching and learning are natural and intentional. 

help others gain the power of the mind 
 - mind-body connection
 - consciousness 
 - passion
  - each other's passions
 - how to live outside the 9-5 realm


a place to bring more open minds into the same room and encourage them to open it

it will be a building with:
 - Sectionable / open plan kitchen, lounge, rec area
 - Ready to go podcast room(s)
 - Meeting rooms
  - tabel andd chairs
  - couch 


## Teaching Calendar
An open calendar that contains the lessons and availability of areas. 

Embracing the [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) teaching to learn technique
Every student will have the opportunity to teach.
Everyone will have the opportunity to learn.


anyone that wants to teach/run a session will be 

an area where people can learn and teach
no one will be a teacher nor a student but both 

if you know whats going on, you will be encouraged to help others learn
if you don't know, you will be prompted to learn 

built around the mind-body connection, embracing, and teaching the energetic connection

## Locations?
### Factory
They already have the office spaces, a kitchen, and an open recreational area.


The office spaces could be renovated into a podcast room and a small meeting room. 
 The podcasts space will be plug and play, no set up required. 
 Having no setup required allows there to be less friction when ideating/communicating.  

The kitchen will be fully stocked equipment-wise and built in an open plan manner. 
Allowing anyone to cook anything and allowing them to use the space to teach. 

### Geographically
I think it should be close to;
 - public transport
 - A highway / main road
 - Parking lot
 - Accommodation
